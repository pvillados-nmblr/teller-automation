t6.1.2 Generate End of Day Report (Valid Closing Date)
    [Documentation]    Verify that selecting a valid closing date enables the Download CSV button,
    ...                triggers a download, and the CSV file passes all content checks:
    ...                - File name matches: <bank-name>_transactions_report_<date>.csv
    ...                - Column headers in order: Transaction ID, Transaction Type, Date & Time,
    ...                  Debit Account Name, Debit Account Number, Credit Account Name,
    ...                  Credit Account Number, Transaction Amount, Service Fee Amount, Total Amount
    ...                - Date & Time format: yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss
    ...                - All transactions are on the selected closing date only
    ...                - Internal and External transactions are present in the file
    ...                  but excluded from balance computation
    ...                - Balance = sum of Deposit + Withdraw Transaction Amounts
    ...                  (amounts are pre-signed: Withdraw is negative in CSV)
    ...                NOTE: Failed external transactions cannot be identified without
    ...                a Status column — that rule requires manual verification.
